# CP316_RTOS_prj
we will be using this repository for our project progression
link in i consists of our project master file
please make a copy of it in your local and work on your module
Manoj has a backup of this file system to revert if required
in bsp2 , global.h and global.c are created as adapter files
what are adapter files ? : incase you have dependency with other module and it is not yet integrated, you can use this module to write temporary code with clear instructions and share it to the respective depedency owner to adopt
I have edited makefile to include these filesystem
once you develop and validate your module , you should be able to  integrate it and verify with the latest version of master file copy and then only you can upload it to master - any doubts - please check with Manoj 
without validation and confirmation - don't update master file
Communication is very important ,so please ensure you use teams channel to provide information if you are going to modify master file
